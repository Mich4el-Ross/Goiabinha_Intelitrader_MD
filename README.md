## üìñ About

<p align="justify"> APIs are needed to bring applications together in order to perform a designed function built around sharing data and executing pre-defined processes. They work as the middle man, allowing developers to build new programmatic interactions between the various applications people and businesses use on a daily basis. </p>

<p align="justify"> As a way to achieve this goal, Intelitrader presents to the employee, in the period of experience, the challenge of <b>creating an API using .NET core  with the integration of a database.</b> And this repository contains just that. </p>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info
